// number => 2 to power 53      it is the range of number tha we get in memory address

// bigint => if no. is too big then only we use bigint especially in trading, stockmarket and in very large websites like reddit, facebook, etc

// string => "", ''
// boolean => true/false
// null => standalone  value ( when we want an empty value)
// undefined => value is still not assigned
// symbol => to find uniqueness symbol is used


// object


console.log(typeof null);  //output of this is => object
console.log(typeof undefined); // output of this is => undefined (because it is type in javascript)
